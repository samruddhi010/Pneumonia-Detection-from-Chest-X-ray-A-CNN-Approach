Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images: A CNN Approach
I built a convolutional neural network model to detect pneumonic lungs from chest X-rays, which can be utilized in the real world by medical practitioners to treat pneumonia. Also, Iemployed pretrained deep transfer learning models such as: DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50 to compare the results with the proposed convolution neural network.

For this Purpose, I used Kaggle data set. Chest X-ray images (anterior posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
